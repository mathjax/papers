Accessibility Features for Advanced Mathematics in the new MathJax Version 3

MathJax is a Javascript library for TeX-like typesetting of Mathematics on the
web. Since its beginnings one of its goals is to provide accessibility support
for blind and visual impaired people; either by supporting third party assistive
technology or, more recently, via it's own integrated accessibility extension.

In MathJax's new version 3 the accessibility extension is not only again an
important aspect but has been considerably improved in terms of the information
it can provide on formulas. With support from the Simons Foundation we developed
improved semantic recognition of source material as well as means to exploit
context information in documents. One particular emphasis is to provide better
accessibility to advanced mathematical material exploiting information gained
from the original LaTeX code, to provide more appropriate speech for different
areas of Mathematics but also for subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Logic.
Our aim is to ease the study of mathematics for more people with visual
impairments as well as to encourage subject specialists to contribute via better
authored content, semantically meaningful LaTeX packages, and expert knowledge
for speech generation.
