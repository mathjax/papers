\begin{abstract}
  Accessibility of mathematics is still a challenging problem and providing the
  right level of support to a reader depends on many factors, such as their
  particular assistive technology needs, their level of expertise, and the
  subject area they are working in. We present work towards making math
  accessibility more adaptable to the reader's personal needs that is
  implemented in the MathJax library for rendering mathematics on the web. While
  MathJax provided accessibility support for several years, the new version 3
  has both more new features and means of personalization. In particular, it
  provides adaptable combinations of highlighting, colorization, and
  magnification techniques. Both Braille and speech output can be generated,
  with different speech rule sets allowing readers to flexibly change
  presentation and adaptation for better interpretation of formulas in
  different subject areas, like Physics, Chemistry, and Logic.

\section{Introduction}

Assistive technology support for mathematical expressions has always been a
challenging problem that is characterized by a number of often competing
affordances and requirements: There exist multiple markup languages in which to
represent formulas; even in the same markup language multiple ways exist to
describe the same formula; readers often have different assistive technology
needs; they have different levels of expertise; or work with material from
different subject areas.

Consequently, a number of technology solutions have experimented over time with
support for different aspects of the problem. From software for generating Math
Braille~\cite{maddox2007mathematical}, over dedicated screen readers that work
on different input languages~\cite{raman1994aster,soiffer2005mathplayer}, to
tools for dyslexia support~\cite{equatio}. Some of these systems also support
different areas of mathematics although mainly geared towards high-school
curricula.

Modern web technology offers the possibility to combine multiple features into a
single medium by augmenting DOM structure with custom data on alternative format
information without altering visual representation. In
MathJax~\cite{MathJax2.7}, a JavaScript library for TeX-quality typesetting of
Mathematics on the web, we have exploited this approach since version 2.7 to
provide an accessibility extension that aims to give flexible support for
readers with visual and print impairments (i.e., readers with cognitive
disorders like dyslexia)~\cite{cervone2016towards}.  Although MathJax can render
the three most common markup language for Mathematics ({\LaTeX}, ASCIIMath,
MathML), none of these has sufficient semantic information to allow for adequate
accessibility support. Consequently MathJax relies on an improved semantic
interpretation of formulas, which is provided by the Speech Rule Engine
(SRE)~\cite{SRE}, a system that provides speech generation for mathematical
expressions given in presentation MathML.

In this paper we present, how embedded semantics is employed to provide a number
of assistive technology features in MathJax, with a particular emphasis on
features new to version 3 and personalization aspects, that exploit SRE's
advanced features like Braille generation, adaptations for reading style and
subject areas, like Physics, Chemistry, and Logic.


% SRE has been augmented with a number of additional features in recent
% years that can be exposed in MathJax directly.  In addition, we have added new,
% bespoke features in MathJax itself, which are mainly aimed at supporting readers
% with low vision or learning impairments.

% In this paper we describe the current state of math accessibility in MathJax,
% presenting both features that exist in version~2.7~\cite{cervone2016towards} and
% are novel to version~3. We will concentrate in particular on the novel adaptable
% features and personalisation aspects of the new version.






% has as its mission to provide not only visiual mathematics rendering on all
% browsers and platforms, but also
% accessibility support for blind and visually impaired people. This is achieved
% either by supporting third-party assistive technology or, more recently, via
% it's own integrated accessibility extensions. In MathJax's new version 3, the
% accessibility extensions remain not only an important feature, but have been
% considerably improved in terms of the information they can provide on formulas.

% For expressions entered in {\LaTeX} format, an additional
% emphasis is to provide better accessibility to advanced mathematical
% material exploiting information gained from the original {\LaTeX} code, to provide
% more appropriate speech for different areas of Mathematics, but also for subjects
% like Physics, Chemistry and Logic.  Our aim is to ease the study of mathematics
% for more people with visual impairments, as well as to encourage subject
% specialists to contribute via better authored content, semantically meaningful
% {\LaTeX} packages, and expert knowledge for speech generation.


% Personalisation aspects:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Automatic voicing of formulas
% \item Interactive navigation with synchronised highlighting
% \item Different collections of speech rules like MathSpeak and ClearSpeak
% \item Nemeth Braille output
% \item Subject specific voicing for advanced mathematics
% \item Different magnification and zoom engines
% \item Variety of highlighting styles
% \end{itemize}

% All this depends on a rich semantic representation of mathematical formulas.

% Although MathJax can render the three most common markup language for
% Mathematics --- {\LaTeX}, ASCIIMath, and MathML --- none of these has sufficient
% semantic information to easily allow for the generation of meaningful speech,
% explanations, or subject-specific highlighting.

\section{Semantic Enrichment}
\label{sec:semantic-enrichment}

One of the main challenges to produce useful assistive technology support in
MathJax is the lack of semantic information in most standard mathematical markup
notations. Formulas are usually given in formats that are geared towards visual
representations, such as {\LaTeX}, ASCIIMath, or MathML, with {\LaTeX} being
clearly prevalent on the majority of web pages. Similarly, MathJax was originally
designed exclusively for displaying formulas, offering a number of different
rendering solutions, such as HTML with CSS or SVG output.
Figure~\ref{fig:semantic-tree} presents two standard ways of representing the
quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, in {\LaTeX} on the top and in MathML on
the left. Both are given in a flat structure, that is sufficient for a linear
representation but in general is not enough to create good mathematical
explanations and interaction support.

Consequently, the first step towards accessibility support in MathJax is by
imposing a semantic interpretation on a given math expression and generating a
tree representation that can be embedded into rendered MathJax expressions to
ensure a similar user experience across browsers. The idea of the semantic
interpretation is an extension of the heuristics implemented in the screen
reader ChromeVox~\cite{Sorge14} and further developed in the context of
MathJax~\cite{cervone2016towards}, which effectively rewrites a flat expression
into a term tree structure by first interpreting the basic nature of symbols, and
propagating this through the expression to determines the scope of operators,
relations, etc. Figure~\ref{fig:semantic-tree} presents this transformation for
the example of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, which is rewritten
from either its MathML or {\LaTeX} form into its semantic interpretation on the
right.

The resulting semantic tree can be understood as an orthogonal view of the
mathematical expression. To exploit it, we embed it using \texttt{data}
attributes into the DOM elements that represent MathJax's rendering of the
equation regardless of the choice of a particular rendering solution. MathJax
offers several different output formats, where expressions in the DOM are
collections of \texttt{div} and \texttt{span} elements, HTML5 custom elements,
or SVG graphics elements. These collections often don't correspond well to the
mathematical structures they represent.  Figure~\ref{fig:rendered} contains the
MathJax's DOM output using HTML5 custom elements. \texttt{data} attributes
\texttt{type}, \texttt{role}, \texttt{id}, \texttt{parent}, \texttt{children},
\texttt{content}, and \texttt{speech} are injected (here the
\texttt{data-semantic-} prefix is omitted to preserve space and improve
readability). The actual semantic tree structure is represented via the
\texttt{id}, \texttt{parent}, \texttt{children}, and \texttt{content}
attributes. Note that data attributes provide a fast and standardized means of
retrieving information from the DOM that is fully consistent with HTML5
practices.


\section{Accessibility Features}
\label{sec:at-solution}

The assistive technology extension that we have built for MathJax is mainly
aimed at supporting users with reading disorders, such as dyslexia, and visual
impairments. However, some aspects of it could also be used as a general aid for
readers unfamiliar with the content or for learners at different levels. We
summarize the main features in this section.

\subsection{Speech Output}

One main emphasis of the assistive technology extension is to support
screen-reader users, but make them independent of their particular
screen-reader's Math capabilities. MathJax exploits SRE's feature to provide
aural rendering for mathematical expressions. Speech string computation is based
on the embedded semantic tree. Speech strings for a formula are either generated
on the fly when running MathJax in a browser client, or pre-computed by a page
author, when formulas are pre-rendered and inserted into the DOM.

To expose the speech strings to a screen reader, MathJax uses two main
techniques.  Firstly, a description of an entire formula is given in the ARIA
label at the top level of the DOM structure representing the expression.
Figure~\ref{fig:rendered} demonstrates the ARIA label embedding as well as the
use of a custom data attribute for speech. The latter allows us to aurally
render not only the entire formula but each of its sub-expressions, which is
exploited during user interaction with the formula, as discussed below.  For
this purpose, MathJax introduces a dedicated assertive ARIA live region into the
DOM and updates it with the desired speech output. Content changes in the live region
are picked up by screen readers and spoken. This is a feature that is
particularly in line with MathJax's mission to support mathematics
rendering in all browsers and on all platforms, working with any modern screen
reader that supports live regions.


\subsection{Tactile Output}

In addition to speech output, SRE now provides generation of Braille
output using Unicode Braille symbols. It currently supports translation of
expressions into Nemeth Braille~\cite{nemeth1972nemeth} only, but we plan to support
additional Math Braille styles in the future. In MathJax we can make use of this
feature by computing Nemeth output as a further rendering mode in parallel to
visual and speech output.

Unfortunately, there is currently no easy way to get tactile output to the user
during regular reading, as most screen readers translate text internally into
Braille, which is not necessarily helpful for Mathematics that needs specific
Braille formats. In particular there is no way to inject Braille directly into
alt text or aria labels for screen readers to simply pick it up and pass it on.
However, during user interaction with a formula, MathJax takes control so that
Braille content can be exposed. This is similar to speech: The Unicode Braille
is simply pushed into a second live region which can be picked up by a screen
reader that directly pushes it onto a connected Braille display.

\def\myparagraph#1{\vspace{1ex}\noindent\textbf{#1} ---}

\subsection{Visual Aids}

MathJax also offers a number of assistive techniques based on visual alteration
and enhancement of formulae. While these are mainly geared towards supporting
readers with low vision or other print impairments like dyslexia, they can also
help a general audience to improve understanding formulas and their structure.

\myparagraph{Highlighting and Contrast} Math expressions generally are large
collections of mostly unconnected symbols in a two-dimensional layout, which can
be particularly daunting for readers with dyslexia.  Reading comprehension can
be supported, however, by a choice of high-contrast
colors~\cite{rello2012optimal} and selective
highlighting~\cite{jones2008strategies}. We realize this in MathJax by offering
changes of fore- and background colors, and selective highlighting of
sub-expressions. In the case of the former, the entire
formula is simply colored to simulate a colored overlay to provide high-contrast
in itself or to offset it from the surrounding text.  For the latter, we again
exploit the semantic structure of the formula to provide a more meaningful
highlighting of sub-formulas. Below is a simple example of progressive shading
for the quadratic equation:
\def\cb#1{\colorbox{yellow}{\ensuremath{\!\!\displaystyle#1\!\!}}}
\def\cc#1{\colorbox{GreenYellow}{\ensuremath{\!\!\displaystyle#1\!\!}}}
\[\cc{\cb{ax^2} + \cb{bx} + \cb{c}} = \cc{\rule[3ex]{0pt}{0pt}0}\]
In practice, sub-expressions are highlighted when hovering over them with the
mouse pointer, or by switching highlighting on permanently. This can be
recursively refined for sub-expressions, e.g., hovering on the denominator or
numerator of a fraction only. For permanent highlighting, the opaqueness of the
background gradually increases in nested sub-expressions. Nevertheless, in large
expressions, highlighting is of limited utility in getting an overview of the structure
of a formula; to aid this further, we introduce a technique for
structural abstraction.

\myparagraph{Structural Abstraction}
The idea of structural abstraction is to assist readers by simplifying the
structure of the formula initially and letting them individually explore the
equation by manually expanding selected sub-expressions. Below is an example of
structural abstraction for the quadratic equation, where the left-hand side is
collapsed into a single addition symbol that can be expanded to the full sum by
clicking on it.
\[\collapse{+}=0\]
While in this case the abstraction is fairly trivial (for some more complex
examples see~\cite{cervone2016towards}), for large or complex formulas and
equation systems, abstraction can often significantly simplify the visual
appearance, leading to less cognitive load for a reader, as well as a better
understanding of the basic structure of an expression. In addition, abstractions
can aid in producing concise speech descriptions via summarizing of formulas
or parts thereof. This can be particularly important for presenting formulas
inline in mathematical texts, where a reader might want to understand the whole
text without having their reading flow constantly interrupted by every formula
being spoken in minute detail. In addition, visual abstraction can be helpful in
presenting mathematics on small form factor displays by adapting formulas to the
page reflow to avoid the need for excessive panning in a page.


\myparagraph{Formula Coloring}
An alternative means to providing support to readers with print impairments is
to heighten the contrast of elements within a formula itself. This effectively
amounts to offsetting neighboring symbols as much as possible with contrasting
colors. While this could be done in a linear fashion, exploiting the semantic
tree structure allows for a similar effect while also offering the possibility
of retaining the same or similar colors for the same or similar operations. A
tree Coloring example for the quadratic equation is given below:
\[\color{blue}a \color{OliveGreen}x^2 \color{red}+ \color{blue}b
  \color{OliveGreen}x \color{red}+ \color{blue}c \color{black}= \color{magenta}0\]
\myparagraph{Magnification}
While changing contrasts can already help low-vision users, many rely on screen
magnification to read content.  MathJax supports magnification in multiple ways:
standard browser zoom is supported by re-rendering mathematics at the new size.
MathJax also provides global scaling settings to enlarge all math elements at
once.  Individual math expressions can be further magnified using a ``lens''
that ordinarily offers a zoom window on top of an expression, with scrolling to
pan across the entire zoomed expression. Exploiting the semantic markup,
magnification can also be restricted to particular sub-expressions only, as in
the example below.


\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{magnification}  
\end{center}


\subsection{Interactive Features}

Since mathematical formulas are generally of a complex nature, and already a
small formula can make for a complex utterance, just listening to an expression
once is generally not enough for comprehension. Therefore, it is particularly
important to provide the reader with a means of engaging with formulas
interactively. MathJax offers an interface for interactive exploration of
mathematical expressions that allows a reader to step through sub-expressions.
Technically, this is realized by giving each math expression an ARIA role of
\texttt{application}, and upon entering an expression, the user can walk it
using the cursor keys.

During this exploration, many of the previously described features can be
restricted to sub-expressions as well. Speech strings can be
computed for all sub-expressions and voiced by updating the ARIA live region
introduced in the DOM. Similarly highlighting as well as magnification can be
synchronized to the exploration using CSS techniques.

It is important to note that the walking is not done in a linear
``left-to-right'' fashion, but instead follows the embedded semantic tree
structure. Thus starting with the entire expression, the next lower level
consists, for instance in the case of the quadratic equation, of the sum on the
left hand side of the equation, the equality sign and the $0$ on the right.  The
sum can then be further explored allowing the reader to step through the single
summands from left to right, and so on.  Note also that navigating the semantic
tree ensures that the user experience of exploring a structure is the same
regardless of the specific renderer used even though their underlying DOM trees
differ.  In addition to this, MathJax also provides the ability to query the
position of elements in a formula, means to summarize the expression currently
highlighted, cursor virtualization, as well as special navigation modes for
matrices and equation systems.


\section{Adaptation and Personalization}
\label{sec:challenges}

While MathJax always supported personalization of the accessibility extension,
for example by individual choice of fore- and background colors for highlighting or
determining the size of magnification, the new version 3 will have a greater
emphasis on adaptation to personal needs and content. We will summarize a few:

\myparagraph{Pick and Mix} One goal is to provide compatible accessibility
components so they can be flexibly combined.  For example, users can have both
speech and Braille output or combine goal-directed magnification with
exploration and highlighting, where either can be done in a different
contrasting colors. This will allow for a pick and mix strategy that a reader
can tailor towards their individual needs.

\myparagraph{Altering Speech} Another features is to switch alternative speech
output even during interaction. We particular concentrate on two alternatives:
MathSpeak~\cite{MathSpeak} and ClearSpeak~\cite{frankel2016development} provided
by SRE. As example, consider the quadratic formula, i.e., the solution to the
quadratic equation we have used as example so far:
\[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\] Its MathSpeak translation is \emph{``x
  equals StartFraction negative b plus-or-minus StartRoot b squared minus 4 a c
  EndRoot Over 2 a EndFraction''}, while the corresponding ClearSpeak is
\emph{``x equals the fraction with numerator negative b plus or minus the square
  root of b squared minus 4 a c and denominator 2 a''}.  We see that MathSpeak
uses more disambiguating language, which makes it more suitable for large,
complex expressions, while ClearSpeak provides a more natural speech experience.
The ability to swap the way an expression is spoken will allow readers multiple
views to ease comprehension.

\myparagraph{Domain Specific Semantics} A second way to improve speech and
understanding is to enable more domain specific interpretations for different
mathematical areas and subjects like Physics, Chemistry and Logic. This is
achieved in two ways: Automatically, by MathJax pushing relevant information it
has obtained from {\LaTeX} input formulas to SRE, which can exploit this
information with domain specific heuristics. Since these heuristics are often
incompatible they would normally not fire unless explicitly chosen by a user by
manually setting a domain.

For example consider the following expression from physics:
\[\langle \phi |A|\psi \rangle\]
The formula is in so called bra-ket notation, which expresses vectors and linear
functionals in quantum mechanics. Regular MathSpeak output would be \emph{``left
  angle bracket phi StartAbsoluteValue upper A EndAbsoluteValue psi right angle
  bracket''}, which in the context of physics is wrong, as $A$ is a matrix and
$\phi,\psi$ are vectors. If this expressions stem from a {\LaTeX} formula using
\texttt{physics} or \texttt{braket} packages, or the physics heuristics are
explicitly switched on SRE will produce \emph{``the linear operator A acting on
  bra phi and on ket psi''} instead. However, using the heuristic in a
non-physics can lead to misinterpretation of the meaning and nesting structure
of angle brackets and vertical bars.


% \begin{itemize}
% \item For expressions entered in {\LaTeX} format we can provide better
%   accessibility by information gained from the original {\LaTeX} code, to
%   provide more appropriate speech for different areas of Mathematics, but also
%   for subjects like Physics  Our aim is to ease the study
%   of mathematics for more people with visual impairments, as well as to
%   encourage subject specialists to contribute via better authored content,

% \item Domain adaptation by choice of heuristics
% \item Example: Bra-ket notation.
% \end{itemize}

% subject areas, like Physics, Chemistry, and inference rules in Logic.



\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

The presented novel accessibility features of MathJax are currently in beta
testing, but will be available as an option with the full version 3 release. One
particular emphasis is on ease of personalization by providing flexibly
combinable assistive technology components. A second, equally important aspect
of our work is to enable better support for advanced notation to help
practitioners in many mathematical fields. This is an area that has often been
neglected due to an emphasis on high-school mathematics in many approaches. But
the possibility to better exploit content authored in semantically meaningful
{\LaTeX} in MathJax and complement with appropriate heuristics and speech in SRE
should help us to make progress on this problem.
